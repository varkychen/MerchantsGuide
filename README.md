# Merchant's Guide to the galaxy.

Apparently, the Aliens have their own number system which follows Roman numerals, but with their own symbols. They also define their 
own intergalactic units. Given the definition of each symbol and the intergalactic unit definition, create a program that can answer
questions about the number and quantities.

For example -
  abcd is I
  bcde is V
  cdef is X
  abcd abcd Silver is 55 Metal
  how much is abcd abcd ?
  how many Metails is bcde Silver ?
